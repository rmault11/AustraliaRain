# Forecasting Australia Rain R
Forecasting Rain in Australia using Machine Learning
Used 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australia weather stations to analyze rainfall.
Developed K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers and a Regularized Logistic Regression (Lasso) model to predict
whether or not it will rain the following day in Australia; All models achieved low misclassification error
rates on out of sample test sets with the logit performing the best.
Libraries used: tree, class, glmnet, ROCR, knitr
